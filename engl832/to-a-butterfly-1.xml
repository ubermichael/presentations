         <p>To a Butterfly is a lyric poem written by William Wordsworth at Town End, Grasmere, in
            1802. It was first published in the collection <title>Poems in Two Volumes</title> in
            1807. This poem is transcribed from page 20 of the later <title>Poetical Works of
               Wordsworth</title>.</p>

         <p>Wordsworth wrote two poems addressing a butterfly, of which this is the first and best
            known. In the poem, he recalls how he and his sister Dorothy would chase butterflies as
            children when they were living together in Cockermouth, before they were separated
            following their mother's death in 1778 when he was barely eight years old.</p>
